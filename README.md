This is a project by Codecademy to practice Intermediate Javascript with a focus on test-driven development using Mocha. This is Unit 4/5 of the Front-End Developer Career Path.

Other topics practiced during this project: 
- Mocha keyword (Describe, It, Assert)
- TDD cycle (Red, Green, Refactor)
- Mocha test phases (Setup, Exercise, Verify)

The index_test.js and index.js code was built by me. 

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
