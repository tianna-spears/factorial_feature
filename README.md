This is a project to practice Intermediate Javascript with a focus on test-driven development using Mocha testing. Other topics also practiced during this project are using the assert module, mocha testing library to drive development using tests that follow the setup, exercise, and verification test phases.

This is Unit 4/5 of the Front-End Developer Career Path.

The index_test.js and index.js code was built by me. 

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
